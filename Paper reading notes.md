- **Online Venting: The Impact of Temporal Proximity Cues and Emotionality on Perceptions of Negative Online Review Value**: Consumers identify a negative review that combines near temporal proximity (i.e., posted or written in a way that makes the experience feel temporally close) with negative emotionality as a form of “venting.” They then ascribe the information in the negative review to reviewer-related attributes rather than to relevant product or service quality attributes.
- **Just Keep It: When and Why Returnless Product Returns Foster Brand Support**: The paper finds that returnless returns can increase brand support when (1) proof of a product issue is not required, (2) the decision is framed as specific to the individual consumer and situation, (3) the brand provides a consumer-centric or environmentally motivated rationale, and (4) the brand suggests donating the retained product. _My comment is that returnless return policies can have a significant financial impact on retailers operating on platforms. This raises important questions about how such policies can be designed to prevent abuse, while ensuring that honest customers feel respected and fairly treated. In particular, framing the decision as specific to the consumer or environmental context may be a key mechanism for maintaining perceived fairness and legitimacy._

- **The Beneficent and Maleficent Effects of Simplification on Retirement Savings**: Simplifying retirement account statements improves contribution rates for consumers in the high-ranking firm but reduces contribution rates for consumers in the low-ranking firm. Simplifying information improves processing **fluency**, making it easier to accurately recall firm rank relative to the control, which amplifies behavior bidirectionally: High-ranking (low-ranking) firm consumers more accurately recall their firm’s rank, subsequently increasing (decreasing) contributions. If simplification is harnessed in ways that improve processing fluency and lower perceived switching costs, then simplification can improve retirement savings for everyone either by boosting contributions or encouraging people to switch to higher performing alternatives.
- **Consumer Moral Decision Making: The Impact of Alignable Versus Nonalignable Differences**: In moral attribute tradeoffs, nonalignable (vs. alignable) differences have a greater impact on choice (termed the “nonalignability effect”). [...] consumers prefer an alternative that is superior on a nonalignable moral difference but inferior on an alignable moral difference
